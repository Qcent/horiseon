# Horiseon Refactor Project

## Description
* Refactor existing HTML/CSS to meet Accessibility and maintainability standards
* Clean up any sloppy code
* Fix any broken links
* Consolidate CSS rules
* Reorder CSS rules to follow HTML flow
* Demonstrate ability to use git and GitHub

## Additional Improvements
* Added flex box positioning to header and nav links, fixing the issue of the nav jumping out of the header on mobile or when resizing browser window.
* Changed the hero's static height of 800px to be a max-height of 800px. And a standard height of 90vw. This allows it to scale nicely on smaller screens. and allows the user to get to the content of the web page sooner.
* Now fully mobile responsive. Displays across all screen sizes without content popping out of boxes!

The Desktop Version:
A-lot like the original but makes use of flex box and does away with floats.

The Mobile Version:
Like the original but makes use of flex box column layout to stack the services on top of the benefits.
